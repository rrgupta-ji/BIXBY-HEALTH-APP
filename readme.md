</p>

## Overview

This tutorial capsule is designed to demonstrate how to use result-views, both with a list and a details page. This capsule goes with the following Youtube videos:

The `master` branch of this repository matches the code at the beginning of the video. If you would like to code along with the video, download this code from the master branch and put it inside Bixby Studio.

The `completed` branch of this repository matches the code at the end of the tutorial video along with some added comments and file organization.

The `master` branch starts with the default lack of UI:
